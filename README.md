# human-to-code-transpiler-repo

My goal is definitely to create a program that can understand human language and transfer that meaning to create a script based on what the user writes/says to the program. My very last and ultimate goal with this project is to have created a program that you can write to as if you were talking to a person who will write the script for you. All you have to do is say what you want while the program will understand what you want to make.
First and foremost, I think I'll start with this program having the abilities to create a website in html and css, but later on the goal would have been to have varied scripting languages which the program can understand and translate.

Let's say a person wanted a website and wrote this: "I would like to have a navigation bar at the top. It should have 5 buttons next to each other in the top right corner, the names of these should be Home, News, Reports, Cats, Dogs. 
Then the program should first and foremost generate an html file and a css file or use given files. After that, the program should try to create exactly what the user just wrote.
So it would make a div with class navBar where it inserts 5 buttons with the names "Home, News, Reports, Cats, Dogs".
The program would also work with the css and set the position and propagation the user inputted.
